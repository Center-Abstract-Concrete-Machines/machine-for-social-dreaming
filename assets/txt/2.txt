    The Garden?
    Maybe I've failed so far, but as I brush up close to the spotted muzzle of a reindeer amid the mosses, bilberries and dwarf birches of this sub-artic Krummholz forest I can begin to imagine the ingredients for the lives of a garden. Maybe a gardenâ€™s real purpose is not so much meditative contemplation, but rather a form of material speculation through which we can get to know other life forms?   As our entire planet has become a series of tightly simplistic structural land use strategies, we need a pause, a counter to the barrage of stimuli from the too-bright maps of productive leisure we're all submitted to through the non-spaces of highway-strip-mall-development-tent-city-airport-tarmac-parking-golf-lawn-slums-playground-asphalt-hell-strips? Gardens: speculative ecologies of interruption; communal spaces of maybe; fungal, bacterial, pheremonal, material architectures of carbon quenchers and boosters to support the photosynthesizers...and to a human it might look like beauty, but beauty as a subterranean irruption of physical silence to break the fabric of our daily straightness.
