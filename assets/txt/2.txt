    The Garden?
    Maybe I've failed so far, but as I brush up close to the spotted muzzle of a reindeer amid the mosses, bilberries and dwarf birches of this sub-artic Krummholz forest I can begin to imagine the ingredients for the lives of a garden. Maybe a gardenâ€™s real purpose is not so much meditative contemplation, but rather a form of material speculation through which we can get to know other life forms?
