* Krummholz is a German word meaning wind-twisted and bent, it also refers to an ecosystem based on these bent and twisted trees and the inter-related flora and fauna around them. I became completely entranced by the sub-alpine environment I found in Northern Finland: dwarf birches, berries, mosses, bacteria, lichens... oddly like a self-sustaining capsule, survivors of some generational spaceship establishing itself on a land of rock, wind and 24 hours of sun. I've begun to think of the small garden interventions I would like to create for the Critical Gardening Collective as sculptural spaceships of sorts.
