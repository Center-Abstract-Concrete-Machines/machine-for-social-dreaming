* Krummholz is a German word meaning wind-twisted and bent, it also refers to an ecosystem based on these bent and twisted trees and the inter-related flora and fauna around them. I became completely entranced by the sub-alpine environment I found in Northern Finland: dwarf birches, berries, mosses, bacteria, lichens... oddly like a self-sustaining capsule, survivors of some generational spaceship establishing itself on a land of rock, wind and 24 hours of sun. I've begun to think of the small garden interventions I would like to create for the Critical Gardening Collective as sculptural spaceships of sorts.  When Thierry invented the word "Cybryont'' for the machine/moss creatures we wanted to create for the botanical garden, we had envisioned a symbiosis which in practice has become tenuous, because...what can we actually contribute to living things to the 'bryosphere', how can we establish a form of mediation not under our own control, where there exists a possibility for other life forms to react and change our work?  Our trip to the tundra led to many questions, and a kind of ambivalence around the idea of depositing small ceramic sculptures full of environmental sensors in the landscape.  But, for me, the Krummholz forests have begun to name some alternative suggestions I hope to be able to follow.
