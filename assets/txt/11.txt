    The Krummholz* 
    We invoke — only touch — a sub-reality clause born of confusion — agree no questions asked, no lies, at least, not yet, for if this is a ship, if this is the birch crone universe with bone heels plugged bacterially into mineral — then I’m not even the one playing the fool, just missing the script for this counterfeit invasion — and they are the wizened wise spore babes reincarnating into this krummholz moss mud machine island—the slip of their sliding cryptogram elephant skins splayed across stone looking like nothing at all— Solorina crocea - a crust of livid neon orange mud- till I press and realize it's as wetly warmly yielding as any other body’s skin.
