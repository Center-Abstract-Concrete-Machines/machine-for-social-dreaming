Fly me like a kite
Drink me entirely through my head


Oh, we’re just one
We’re just one star
We’ve been had so many times before
How lovely we again and again meeting
He never left
We’re never going
Never going, really
Even though there’s oceans in between us
We’re always
When frequencies collide, we see our edges
We’re never going
We’re always
only behind what shimmers.
