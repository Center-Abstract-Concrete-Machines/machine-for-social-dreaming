I still think about
the day we met
When you told me about
all the things ever said.
And when I looked in your eyes,
I saw books with pages made of mirrors
stacked in row after row of shelves.
The floor was made of water,
and at the end of the hall it fell down,
cascading
into a tower of cups
I turned to the angel and asked
“Is this for drinking?”
You said to me,
“This is everything. It never ends.”
